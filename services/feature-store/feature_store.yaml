# Feast Feature Store — Social Feed System
#
# Project:      social_feed
# Online store: Redis (shared with the feed mailbox Redis instance)
# Offline store: file — reads from Parquet files generated by
#                materialize_features.py
# Registry:     SQLite file persisted on a Docker volume / k8s PVC
#
# Feast key namespace is isolated from the application's Redis keys:
#   feed:{user_id}   — application feed mailboxes
#   uf:{user_id}     — application user feature cache
#   feast_<project>:*  — Feast-managed online store keys (no collision)
